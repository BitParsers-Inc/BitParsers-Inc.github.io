<p>LightBlender is a system that users can uses installed or pre-installed effect and effect modifiers, to create their own desired effects. This will help both artists and non-artists, to have their own effect design system.</p>
<h2>General usage</h2>
<p>Light-Blender comes with a administration page like below:</p>

<p>As you see in picture above, you have some effects on light-blender. Some of them are pre-installed on light-blender and some other effects are installed independently.</p>
<h2>How to add effects</h2>
<p>Just a look at the bottom of administration page. You will see the list of available effects to use.</p>
<p><img alt="Example list of available effects" src="./index_files/example_available_images.png" title="Example list of available effects"></p>
<p>Each effect usually comes with a <strong>its own documentation</strong>. So try to read them if you are interested in learning more about them and their usage.</p>
<p>To add a new effect, click/tap on them to add an instance of it. For example, assume we want to add a new <strong>Luminous Traveler</strong> effect. To achieve that, you will need to click on <strong>Luminous Traveler</strong>  button, and you will have an instance of it immediately.</p>

<p>You can add multiple effect. LightBlender will mix selected effects together and generate a mixed effect of them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: you can select same effect multiple times, As you can set different parameter for each effect, this can be useful for you. In picture below, <strong>Luminous Traveler</strong>  selected twice, And this can be really useful in many use cases.</p>
